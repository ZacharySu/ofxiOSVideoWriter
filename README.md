ofxiOSVideoWriter is a openFrameworks addon for screen recording on iOS.

It's still a work in progress and for now only runs with this OF branch,
https://github.com/julapy/openFrameworks/tree/ios-videoplayer-updates

but when complete it will allow to capture and record the screen and save to a movie file at interactive frame rates.
